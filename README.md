# Album Buddy

A React band/releases app for self-hosting music

## Intro

After the various changes and annoyances with existing music sharing platforms, I saw a void that felt it needed filling. A solution for independent musicians to be able to easily release their music without the dependency on the existing platforms, while at the same time providing a low barrier way to do so.

## Usage

### Pre-made

For now, until tools/scripting is available, the easiest methods are to clone or download the release branch, and copy and then customize the buddy.json and catalogue.json to fit your needs.

The release branch is available on:

https://github.com/TyIsI/AlbumBuddy/tree/release

### React

Alternatively, you can also clone or download the master branch and build it directly from React.
